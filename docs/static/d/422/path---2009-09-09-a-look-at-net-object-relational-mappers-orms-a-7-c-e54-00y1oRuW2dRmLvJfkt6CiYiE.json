Having used this for almost a year I was curious what the competition was like 3 years on and being indoctrinated into the Active Record pattern, which once you start using makes others seem clumsy. I wouldn’t be switching anytime soon as NH/AR are my job (and as I found out I wouldn’t want to) but I did manage to test Subsonic and the Entiy Framework quite extensively with the Soot project I’ve been making. </p>\n<p>Anyway, my criteria for assessing and ORM was: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Turnkey” abilities of it, or how easy it is to just dive in</li>\n<li>The documentation, support (through forums, FAQ, knowledge bases)</li>\n<li>The date of the last release, to indicate how fresh/stale the project is</li>\n<li>Ease of use and flexibility of the API</li>\n<li>Caching and performance</li>\n<li>Others: inheritance, complex relationships, concurrency</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2 most important features, in my view, of an ORM though are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Querying - dynamic filtering, quality of SQL produced, joining, paging, eager/lazy loading</li>\n<li>Save/Create and unique id handling and ease of use of CRUD operations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://csharp-source.net/open-source/persistence\">CSharp-source details</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sharptoolbox.com/categories/object-relational-mappers\">SharpToolBox list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software\">Wikipedia article</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2008/05/20/how-do-i-new-entity-framework-videos.aspx\">Entity Framework FAQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2008/05/20/how-do-i-new-entity-framework-videos.aspx\">Entity framework Howto videos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/ADONET-Entity-Framework-What-How-Why/\">Entity framework Channel 9 article</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>NHibernate</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/2567151/nhibernate-reference\">NHibernate manual</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nhforge.org/\">Quick start guide, tools, docs etc.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/info/search.aspx?artkw=nhibernate&#x26;sbo=kw\">Codeproject articles about NHibernate</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"A look at .NET Object Relational Mappers (ORM)s","date":"September 09, 2009","description":"This post looks at the many different ORM (object relational mappers) that exist for C#/.NET.
