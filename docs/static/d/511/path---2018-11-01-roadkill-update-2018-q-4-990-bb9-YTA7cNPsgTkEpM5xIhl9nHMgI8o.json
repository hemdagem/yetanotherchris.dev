The main reason for this has been the volatile nature of the .NET ecosystem of the past few years, and uncertainty of the .NET Standard/.NET Core roadmap, up until project.json was ditched recently.</p>\n<p>The project has a lot of stars (almost 250) and watchers on Github, so this post has an update on the status of the project and its various parts.</p>\n<h4>Converting to .NET Core beta, 1.1, 2.1</h4>\n<p>The conversion started with a standard .NET Framework to .NET Core upgrade. This took about 6 months of my free time, and eventually got nowhere as the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/yetanotherchris/197963aec1872c40bba515f8f95b7e0f\">number of changes between the framework was so great.</a></p>\n<p>I changed direction at the start of the year, and have now moved to a direct re-write of Roadkill, moving to an API-first approach.</p>\n<p>Roadkill v3 is an API project, and a website project.</p>\n<h4>The status so far</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users and roles - more details below. Roadkill will now be using AspNetIdentity and get the extra features it supports. <em>(25% done)</em>.</li>\n<li>File uploads and management. Roadkill will support multi-cloud by default (S3, Azure). More details below <em>(25% done)</em>.</li>\n<li>It’s Postgres only using Marten, as having so many databases to support was a major headache, even with an ORM. <em>(100% done)</em></li>\n<li>It’s cross platform and Dockerized <em>(100% done)</em></li>\n<li>It now uses Elasticsearch for search. <em>(50% done)</em></li>\n<li>It’s markdown only, and has been rewritten to use Markdig for Markdown parsing. Subsequently extensions will not be supported for the v3 initial release. <em>(100% done)</em></li>\n<li>HTML Sanitization is done using the <a href=\"https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer\">HtmlSanitization</a> library, which itself is derived from Roadkill v2! Go team. <em>(100% done)</em></li>\n<li>Localization is now a separate project. <em>(100% done)</em></li>\n<li>The API is fairly complete now, minus search and users <em>(80% done)</em></li>\n<li>The admin UI hasn’t been started. I’m looking at SPA framework like ReactJS for this. <em>(0% done)</em></li>\n<li>The front end UI hasn’t been started. Also SPA. <em>(0% done)</em></li>\n<li>Mailing templates are to-do. <a href=\"https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit\">Mailkit</a> is now being used by Roadkill to send mails. <em>(50% done)</em></li>\n<li>Conversion from v2->v3 tool is to-do <em>(0% done)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Users</h4>\n<p>The main bulk of work that is currently being done on Roadkill is around users. It’s being completely re-written using AspNet Identity. I’ve spent a fair amount of time writing <a href=\"https://github.com/yetanotherchris/marten.AspNetIdentity\">this library</a> that enables Marten support for the AspNetIdentity framework.</p>\n<p>I am now exploring IdentityServer4.AspNetIdentity and IdentityServer4 to enable OAuth2 support (login via Twitter, Facebook, Google etc.). Also I’m exploring user interfaces for managing users and roles, with a long term goal of making a re-usable admin interface that can be used to manage AspNetIdentity users.</p>\n<h4>Files</h4>\n<p>Another library I’ve created that Roadkill will use is <a href=\"https://github.com/yetanotherchris/CloudFileStore\">CloudFileStore</a>, which reads and writes files to various cloud providers - for now Google, AWS/S3 and Azure.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>So in short, there’s a lot happening around Roadkill, assembling components that v3 will use. Version 3 will be a complete re-write, but re-using a large chunk of the source code. I’ve wasted around 18 months on bumbling around with .NET Core betas an .NET 1.1, but now it’s on track.</p>\n<p>I should also mention I have commitments for Packt right now, for a new video, so my time is quite limited.</p>\n<p>And any help with the front send SPA frameworks would be welcome.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Roadkill update, 2018 Q4","date":"November 01, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-11-01-roadkill-update-2018-q4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-08-17-high-performance-and-scaling-asp-net-core-and-docker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"High performance and scaling ASP.NET Core 1.1 and Docker"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-11-13-personality-type/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Personality type"}}}}
