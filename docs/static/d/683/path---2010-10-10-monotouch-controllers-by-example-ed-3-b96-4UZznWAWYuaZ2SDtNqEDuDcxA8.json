The learning curve is slightly steeper with this method but you get finer control on your Views and this technique is more familiar if you’re used to laying out controls (or Views in Cocoa land) in code. </p>\n<p>It’s slower to design as you generally adjust pixels and the flow of a view, rebuild and view in the simulator and it’s not the prefered solution if you’re collaborating with a graphic designer who can simply use Interface builder. </p>\n<p>But coming from a .NET winforms, ASP.NET/ASP.NET MVC and even Java Swing background I’m comfortable laying out views in markup and C#, so I’ve decided to write up my adventures as a set of 2 articles.
