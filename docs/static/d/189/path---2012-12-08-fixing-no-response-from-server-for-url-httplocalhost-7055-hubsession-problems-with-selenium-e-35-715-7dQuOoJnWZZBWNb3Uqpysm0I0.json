It took me a good 1/2 day of trial and error to fix the problem, but it’s so obscure I thought I’d share. The error you’ll see from Selenium is usually this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No response from server for url <a href=\"http://localhost:7055/hub/session/%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6\">http://localhost:7055/hub/session/…”</a>;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--more-->\n<p>The error is actually FirefoxDriver related rather than Selenium itself, although ChromeDriver may just fail silently. The problem comes from the security of the default Temp directory on Windows 2008/2007. The solution is fairly straight forward, change the global environmental TEMP and TMP variables to a directory that has read/write access by the Everyone user - for example C:\\temp. You can do this via</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Computer->Properties->Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables->System Variables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s a small security risk but as it’s only a build box it shouldn’t matter much, and fixes the issue.</p>\n<p>I found the clue to the solution from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2774\">this newsgroup posting</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fixing 'No response from server for url http://localhost:7055/hub/session/' problems with Selenium","date":"December 08, 2012","description":"If you're using a Windows Server 2008 R2 for your CI builds and tests, you may run into issues with running Selenium tests that Server 2003 didn't have."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-12-08-fixing-no-response-from-server-for-url-httplocalhost7055hubsession-problems-with-selenium/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-04-04-razor-defining-a-section-inside-a-html-helper-extension-method/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Razor: Defining a section inside a HTML helper extension method"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-02-23-from-squarespace-to-wordpress/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"From Squarespace to WordPress"}}}}
