You can find this in games for the “save game” functionality. The pattern can also accomodate ‘undo’ into it. </p>\n<h3>Proxy</h3>\n<p>Access methods,fields etc. of a class via another class - the proxy. A common use for this is Authentication where you have to be authenticated before you are allowed to use the other classes. The proxy can switch the classes it uses internally as they implement an interface. </p>\n<h3>Command</h3>\n<p>You will have come accross this pattern before if you have dealt with toolbars UI controls. A control’s click event will fire an event which passes just the command name. You have to then switch on the command name and perform the relevant action. </p>\n<h3>Chain of Responsibility</h3>\n<p>An elegant way of passing responsibility up down a linked-list like chain of classes, where each class references the next class up the chain. The next class up has more responsibility, or rights than the previous class. So the first might be “viewer”, the second “editor”, the third “admin”. </p>\n<h3>And there’s more</h3>\n<p>There’s even more my mini-summaries have missed: Template, Visitor, Interpretor, Decorator and Bridge. Wikipedia and the other links <a href=\"/csharp/csharp-design-patterns/\" title=\"C# Design Patterns\">in the first blog post</a> have details on these.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Other Design Patterns","date":"February 08, 2010","description":"Here's a few more design patterns I left out from my design patterns series."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2010-02-08-other-design-patterns/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-02-08-random-photo-of-the-month-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Random photo of the month 2"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-02-16-using-xmltextwriter-to-produce-a-xml-string/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using XmlTextWriter to produce a XML string"}}}}
