The error was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unable to resolve ‘System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters (>= 4.0.0-rc4-24217-03)’ for ‘.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It turns out I had this package in <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Users\\MyUsername\\.nuget\\packages</code> so it restored locally, but on the internet the package isn’t at nuget.org. How did I get it originally? That was a mystery that luckily another project in the solution solved by accident.</p>\n<p>A lot of the .NET Core nuget packages are hosted on myget.org until they’re ready to be fed over to nuget.org. The solution is to add a <code class=\"language-text\">nuget.config</code> file to your project, with this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;configuration&gt;\n  &lt;packageSources&gt;\n    &lt;add key=&quot;nuget.org&quot; value=&quot;https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json&quot; protocolVersion=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;add key=&quot;dotnet-core&quot; value=&quot;https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/packageSources&gt;\n&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>One hour of my life wasted to save you 1 hour!
