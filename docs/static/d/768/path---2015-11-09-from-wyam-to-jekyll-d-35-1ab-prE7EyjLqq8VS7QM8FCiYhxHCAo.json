After battling with a terrible Wordpress theme, we settled on using Jekyll and static HTML. This was fairly serendipitous for me, as I got a crash course on getting Jekyll to run on Windows, the template engine it uses called Liquid, and getting free-hosting from Github.</p>\n<p>The steps are a lot easier than I thought:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a Github repository called <code class=\"language-text\">{your-username.github.io}</code> e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">yetanotherchris.github.io</code></li>\n<li>Add a .gitignore for Jekyll</li>\n<li>Clone it, and add some default folders as the Jekyll docs describe.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">choco install ruby</code></li>\n<li>Close the powershell console, open a new one.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">gem install jekyll</code></li>\n<li>CD into your repository, <code class=\"language-text\">jekyll server</code></li>\n<li>Go to ”<a href=\"http://localhost:4000\">http://localhost:4000</a>” and be amazed.</li>\n<li>Add a CNAME file with your domain name.</li>\n<li>Update your DNS records so the A record points to the Github IP.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">git push</code> your repository and watch it appear on <a href=\"http://yourusername.github.io\">http://yourusername.github.io</a> and in 10 minutes, your domain you set in the CNAME file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most of the time spent was converting to the Liquid templating engine, which is just like the hundreds of other templating engines such as Smarty, and making the markdown files Jekyll-friendly.</p>\n<p>The source for the site is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/yetanotherchris/yetanotherchris.github.io\">https://github.com/yetanotherchris/yetanotherchris.github.io</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"From Wyam to Jekyll","date":"November 09, 2015","description":"Converting the blog over to Jekyll for free Github hosting."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2015-11-09-from-wyam-to-jekyll/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-11-04-unit-test-naming-conventions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unit test naming conventions"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-11-11-creating-a-chocolately-package-for-chromedriver/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a Chocolately package for Chromedriver"}}}}
