Just add more containers??</p>\n<p>Unfortunately not, it was far more involved than that (particularly as the orchestration tool chosen wasn’t particularly easy to scale with).</p>\n<p>We learned a lot while soak testing, and regrettably with live traffic too, exactly how sensitive .NET Core applications at this scale are to the smallest contention issue with threading, networking and also tweaks to the Docker container and the orchestration tool (ECS in this case).</p>\n<p>One of these was the ulimit default you have on a container.

There were half a dozen other issues which I could go into more detail - HttpClient problems, containers crashing silently from being out of resources but they were all eventually resolved. In .NET 2.1 (the current LTS version) everything was ironed out and the only real issue we suffered was feature-limitations of ECS.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"High performance and scaling ASP.NET Core 1.1 and Docker","date":"August 17, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-08-17-high-performance-and-scaling-asp-net-core-and-docker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-07-28-photo-of-the-month/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Photo of the month"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-11-01-roadkill-update-2018-q4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roadkill update, 2018 Q4"}}}}
