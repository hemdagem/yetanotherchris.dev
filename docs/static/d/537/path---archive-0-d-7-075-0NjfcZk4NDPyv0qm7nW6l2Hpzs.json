You can customise these fields, and you also get a set of core fields, but you also get to choose the workflow of each field. For example you can’t set a bug to closed, before it’s been resolved."}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I have been lucky enough to receive a review copy of Mike Bluestein’s “Learning Monotouch”.
