This will probably change soon when it gets bloated with plugins, toolbars and google tie-in. A bit like Firefox, Chrome has a wealth of about: screens you can use to view what’s going on in the browser. Below is a list of about pages Chrome has available, taken from various blogs, blog comments and looking at the DLLs it uses in a hex editor.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>about:config</h3>\n<p>Shows a blank screen for now</p>\n<h3>about:memory</h3>\n<p>Displays more information about Chrome and other running browsers’ memory usage than you would possible ever want, unless you’re developing a browser of course.</p>\n<h3>about:network</h3>\n<p>Displays some fairly basic information about network performance and timings for page requests.</p>\n<h3>about:stats</h3>\n<p>In depth information about the innards of Chrome, timers and counters on chrome events from the looks of things.</p>\n<h3>about:dns</h3>\n<p>Displays tabular data about which sites are cached. My list contained mostly google dns entries.</p>\n<h3>about:internets</h3>\n<p>The tubes are clogged</p>\n<h3>about:cache</h3>\n<p>A list of all items in the cache with a link to each item to view it.</p>\n<h3>about:histograms</h3>\n<p>An ascii set of histograms of Chrome events. Load time, dns fetch time,favicon fetching and all kinds of things.</p>\n<h3>about:plugins</h3>\n<p>Tabular data about the plugins loaded such as flash, wmp, quicktime.</p>\n<h3>about:version</h3>\n<p>The current version of Chrome.</p>\n<h3>about:hang</h3>\n<p>This causes Chrome to simulate hanging after a bit of a delay. This then causes a hang dialog to appear.</p>\n<h3>about:shorthang</h3>\n<p>Similar to about:hang</p>\n<h3>about:crash</h3>\n<p>Causes the current tab to crash causing a sad face to appear.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google chrome about pages","date":"March 03, 2009","description":"Inside the amazing world of Chrome about pages."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-03-03-google-chrome-about-pages/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-03-03-friendly-unique-id-generation-part-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Friendly Unique Id Generation Part 1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-03-05-friendly-unique-id-generation-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Friendly Unique Id Generation part 2"}}}}
