This is a modification of [this page][1] that I adjusted for 2012 UK statistics.

I'm tired because I'm overworked. Let me explain&#8230;

<!--more-->

  * The population of the UK is 62 million. 9 million are retired. That leaves 55 million to do the work.
  * There are 12 million who are underage or still in school, and 30 people who are still working on their PhD's since the 50's, which leave 42 million to do the work.
  * Two hundred thousand are in the Armed Forces, which leaves forty one and a half million to do the work.
  * Of this there are 6 million employed by the public sector. This leaves 35.5 million to do the work. 
  * Now, there are 100,000 people in prisons, so that leaves 35.4 million to do the work.
  * There are 1.6 million unemployed, leaving 33.8 million to do the work.
  * There are 50,200 people being treated in hospitals, at doctor appointments, or on sick leave today. That leaves just <strike>35,399,999 people</strike> two people to do the work.
  * You and me.

And you're sitting there playing around on the Internet!

*All that time researching the UK figures, and I realised the stats on the original page are completely made up.*
