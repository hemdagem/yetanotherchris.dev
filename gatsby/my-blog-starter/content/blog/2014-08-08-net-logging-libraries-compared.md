This is a short presentation I created for the company I work for, and gives my thoughts on the state of .NET logging libraries in 2014. 
My knowledge comes from day-to-day use of MSEntLib and log4net and moving from TraceListener to NLog in Roadkill. The presentation comes from a web and windows service perspective.
