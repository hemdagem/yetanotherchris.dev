In the UK we're fortunate enough to get 5 free holidays a year, under the guise of &#8220;Bank Holidays&#8221;. These are mostly on Mondays and come in January, March/April, May, August and December.

Below is a calculator for working out the dates of these holidays, along with tests for the next 5 years. The class tells you if you're on a bank holiday, but could be easily changed to return the bank holiday dates. For now, it doesn't tell you if you're on the Boxing Day bank holiday.
