This is a slightly modified Silverlight based version of Douglas Crockford's [JSMIN Javascript minifier][1]. It removes whitespaces and comments to make download speeds slightly faster for high bandwidth sites. It doesn't obfuscate the script, which is a trickier process. If you know how to execute Java JARs on the command line, you might consider the [YUI compressor][2] too. Or alternatively [Dean Edward's packer][3], which comes as a windows GUI application with lots of options.
