My podcast recommendation for this week comes from Sam Harris's discussion with David Chalmers about consciousness. 

The 2nd half gets a little bit waffly when discussing the future of AI - coming from current fears that [Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461431284&sr=8-1&keywords=Superintelligence) started last year, but the first half covers conciousness really well. 

In particular:

- What is consciousness? Is it actually anything or just a by-product of all the data our brains receive?
- Is everything in the universe conscious? If so, are thermostats conscious?
- Mmmmmm brains: the zombie analogy for consciousness.
