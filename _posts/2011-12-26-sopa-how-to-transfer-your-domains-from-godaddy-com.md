I'm not really fuming about the SOPA issue as I live in the UK, however given [the amount of DNS control the US has][1], it is worth giving a little-bit-of-a-crap about.

If you happen to use Godaddy for your domains, you might be considering moving away from them after it was revealed that they played quite a big part in penning the details of SOPA (mostly for their own business gain).

[Here's a great post][2] on how to transfer your domains to Namecheap.com who are against the SOPA legislation. You give the author a referral but that's fine with me. You can also check which big websites still use Godaddy on [Byedaddy.org][3]
