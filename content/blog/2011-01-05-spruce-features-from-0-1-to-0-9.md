The following list is the features I’m aiming to implement between version 0.1 and 0.9. Search is a fairly critical one so this will be top of the list, once I’ve finished polishing the UI.

**Search**

<!--more-->

  * Title, desc contains
  * Assigned to, created by etc. contains (autocomplete textbox)
  * Ever support
  * Dates support (ASOF in WIQL)
  * Show WIQL as option
  * &#8220;Not&#8221; support
  * Other fields support: area, iteration
  * …Powerful but also simple, it should not be feature bloated or trying to compete with the VS interface

**Core features**

  * Favourites
  * History
  * Relationships (in order of priority) :
  * Linked workitems + the CRUD interface for them: Parent/child, Predecessor/sucessor, Related, \* \* Affected by/affects,
  * Attachments + CRUD

**Filtering**

  * Today, yesterday, this week, etc.
  * Assigned to me, anyone
