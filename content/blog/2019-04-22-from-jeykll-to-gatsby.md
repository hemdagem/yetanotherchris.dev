My blog, or site full of random programming content really (blogs didn't really exist in 2001 when I started it), began with the domain [sloppycode.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20050405210904/http://www.sloppycode.net:80/)

I can't remember when I abandoned that domain, but the site had a flurry of updates in 2008-2013, and has stagnated a bit over the past years.

It's gone from PHP to .NET webforms, to Umbraco, to C1 CMS, to Squarespace, to Wordpress, to Wyam, to Jeykll/Github pages and now it's on [Gatsby](http://www.gatsbyjs.org) which has been a fun learning curve, and hosted with the excellent [netlify.com](http://netlify.com)

Needless to say that in 2019 it's far easier to publish custom content than back in 2001, with the site being in a decent standardized format - Markdown and Frontmatter, inside a Git repository and auto-published with virtually everything you need out of the box thanks to Gatsby and Netlify.

I'm hoping to add some new content over the coming months.
