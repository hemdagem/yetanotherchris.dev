From the excellent [16personalities.com (I'm a sucker for nice vector cartoon artwork), I was an INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality). 

It's really just a Meyer Briggs test with a few extra bells and whistles, which tends to label people and generalise - and can venture into almost horoscope territory - however it's a good indication of the sort of personality someone roughly is (and how honestly they answer the questions).
