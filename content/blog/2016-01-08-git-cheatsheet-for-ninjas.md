description: A slowly increasing list of advanced and everyday Git command line usage.
---

One of my favourite parts of working with Mercurial for 2 years was its command line, and committing and updating through it. 
I'm using Git now rather than Mercurial, but the same principal still applies for me - command line first, and UI mainly for diffs.
I prefered Mercurial's diffing and branching but on the whole you can go between the two fairly effortlessly.

Below is a list of advanced Git usage I'm accrueing, largely thanks to the Git ninjas I work with, Stackoverflow and a tiny amount of self-discovery.
