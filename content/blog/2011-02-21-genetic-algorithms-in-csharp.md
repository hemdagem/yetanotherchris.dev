The code below is a 3.5 upgrade to Barry Lapthorn's original C# example [found on codeproject][1]. I've .NET'ised it a bit more (inline with the Framework Guidelines book) and given it a facelift using a Func for the fitness function and autogenerated properties. It should also run a lot faster without the boxing and unboxing required by ArrayList, as it now employs List<Genome> for its generations.

I'm in the middle of writing my own version of a C# Genetic Algorithm example, however unlike Barry's example mine uses bit strings to represent the genes in the genomes. I'm also planning on giving a bit background information to GAs in the article, based on my knowledge from a recent university course - compressing an explanation into several paragraphs will be an interesting test of the completeness of my knowledge.

## Example usage

As with Barry's original example you use it like so (with the delegate fluff now removed thanks to the v3 compiler):

`gist:yetanotherchris/4984735`

And the 3 classes needed are GA, Genome and GenomeComparer:

## GA

`gist:yetanotherchris/4984748`

## Genome

`gist:yetanotherchris/4984761`

## GenomeComparer

`gist:yetanotherchris/4984775`
