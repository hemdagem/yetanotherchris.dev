**This tool from 2004** is useful if you need to do a quick update of a binary column in a SQL server 2000 table. It could be easily adapter for other dbs such as Access or mySQL.

It also gives a good example enumerating all databases, tables and columns from a SQL Server database

<!--more-->

As with all the old C# code on the site, the tool is very basic and not intended to be any shiney finished application.
