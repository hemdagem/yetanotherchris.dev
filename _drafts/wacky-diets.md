Over the past three or four years I've done a number of different diets: this is my experience with all of them:

#### Five-two diet

This is a fasting diet championed by the BBC's Dr Mosely. You fast for two days a week (not consecutively), having a total of 600 calories you can consume on those days, typically 300 at breakfast and 300 for dinner.

The diet is good for weight loss, but is even better for resetting your ideas on what you need to eat. You discover that you spend a lot of your time eating from boredom, and as a bonus the ketosis state you enter makes you feel incredibly lucid a lot of the time.

However you also are a moody git to be around in between the meals. Infact, the extra adrenaline you have from the fasting state, when combined with coffee can completely alter the person you are temporarily - good for weight training perhaps but not so good if you're with company. Sleeping is also very hard. I always tended to go over the 600 calories last thing at night so I could sleep.
